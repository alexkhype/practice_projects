* A key field is a single column or group of columns that uniquely identifies records in a table. 

INNER JOIN shown looks for records in both tables with the same values in the key field, and ignores any records that do not. 

(1) After FROM, we list the left table, 
(2) followed by the INNER JOIN keyword and the right table. 
(3) We then specify the field to match the tables on, using the ON keyword. 
(4) Lastly, we add SELECT at the start of the query and choose the fields we want returned. 

    (4) SELECT p2.country, p2.continent, primer minister, president
    (1) FROM presidents AS p1                (table  on the left)
    (2) INNER JOIN prime_ministers AS p2     (table on the right)
    (3) ON p1.country = p2.country; 
    (or) USING (country)

When selecting columns that exist in both tables, the table.column_name format must be used to avoid a SQL error. Otherwise, it is not necessary.

We can alias table names using the same AS keyword used to alias column names. 

When joining on two identical column names, we can employ the USING command followed by the shared column name in parentheses. Here, since the join field is named "country" in both tables, we can use USING. 

When writing joins, many SQL users prefer to write the SELECT statement after writing the join code, in case the SELECT statement requires using table aliases.

-- Select name fields (with alias) and region 
SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, countries.region
FROM cities;
-- Inner join to countries
INNER JOIN countries
-- Match on country codes
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;

-- Select fields with aliases
SELECT c.code AS country_code, name, year, inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
-- Join to economies (alias e)
INNER JOIN economies AS e 
-- Match on code field using table aliases
ON c.code = e.code

SELECT c.name AS country, l.name AS language, official
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l
-- Match using the code column
USING(code);
