# Privacy

**Privacy** was defined as "the right to be left alone, or freedom from interference or intrusion".

**Data privacy** is defined as the right to have some control over how your personal data is collected and used; it's about enabling and empowering users to have control over their own data. It can also be thought of as "the authorized and valid processing of personal information".

**Personal Data**, sometimes referred to as Personal Information, is data related to a person or, in some cases, can be used to identify an individual. Examples of personal data include date of birth, name, geolocation, and much more. One of Privacy's main goals is to ensure that Personal data is not compromised by being unexpectedly altered, modified, or stolen.

# Security


Security can be thought of as a precursor to privacy. Privacy is about giving users control over their data. However, User data has to be secured and protected before any meaningful user action can be taken.

**Information Security** or Infosec can be defined as the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Security models

- CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) Triad.
- DIE (Distributed, Immutable, and Ephemeral) model.

### CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality** refers to a system’s ability to ensure that only correct users have access to information. 
	- **Identity Access Management (IAM)** is a component of Confidentiality. IAM ensures that only the right people can access the right resources at the right time. 
		Example: A utility company uses IAM rules to prevent unauthorized access to company information. All of the following rules must be followed for an employee to be able to access and modify resources: The user must have a company email address. The user must be on the corporate network. The user may only access company systems during working hours. Individual's who do not comply with the aforementioned rules will not be able to access resources.

- **Integrity** focuses on ensuring data can be trusted and has not been inappropriately modified. 
	- **Encryption** protects data by scrambling data and making it unreadable. 
	- **Hashing** is the process of converting data to a standardized algorithmic output. This process is not reversible. It is often used to verify that data has not been changed. 
		Example: With "https", the communications between your computer and the website are being hashed and encrypted. This ensures that communications are unreadable and have not been altered.

- **Availability** focuses on ensuring that data systems are accessible and available (up and running). 
	- **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)** can be defined as the processes, policies, and people used to help an organization continue during an unplanned event.
		Example: A flood causes severe damage to a hospital's data center; the data center housed all of the company's servers and storage devices. Luckily, the hospital had an established BCDR process. All of the applications and records were backed up to another location. They did not lose any patient records.

# The relationship between security and privacy

- **Security** is focused on preventing the unauthorized usage, disclosure or alternation of information. This is also emphasized in the CIA Triad. Some examples of traditional security controls include encryption and identity access management (IAM).

- **Privacy controls** are focused on ensuring that personal information/user data is processed in a valid manner that has been authorized by the user or users. Examples of privacy controls include notifications, encryption, etc. 

- Both privacy and security care about ensuring a valid and authorized use case for actions on user data. Both privacy and security can also leverage the same technical controls.

- Strong security and privacy controls are critical to protecting sensitive user data. Without privacy controls, users would be unable to control and modify their data; for example, requesting that their name be changed. Without security controls, companies would not be able to protect data and prevent it from being leaked or stolen. Security and privacy work together to protect user data and ensure that users’ understand what’s being done with their data. You can’t have privacy without security.

- A **data breach** is defined as a security event where data is unlawfully disclosed, altered, or taken by an unauthorized party.
